Question 1:
Using a loop, print the integers from 1 to 50.

```{r}
for(i in 1:50){
  print(i)
  }
```

Question 2:
A. Using a loop, add all the integers between 0 and 1000.

```{r}
t=0
for(i in 1:1000){
  t=t+i
  }
t
```
B. Now, add all the EVEN integers between 0 and 1000 (hint: use seq())

```{r}
s=0
for(i in 1:500){
  s=s+2*i
}
s
```

C. Now, repeat A and B WITHOUT using a loop.

```{r}
a<-seq(0,1000,1)
sum(a)
b<-seq(0,1000,2)
sum(b)
```

Question 3:
Here is a dataframe of survey data containing 5 questions :

```{r, eval=T} 
survey <- data.frame( "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0), "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99), "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10), "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2), "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2) ) 
```

The response to each question should be an integer between 1 and 5. Obviously, we have some bad values in the dataframe. The goal of this problem is to fix them.

A. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called survey.clean where all the invalid values (those that are not integers between 1 and 5) are set to NA.

```{r}
for(i in 1:6)
{for(j in 2:6)
{if(survey[i,j]<1 | survey[i,j]>5 )
      {survey[i,j]<-NA}
  }
}
survey
```

B. Now, again using a loop, add a new column to the dataframe called "invalid.answers" that indicates, for each participant, how many bad answers they gave.

```{r}
for(i in 1:6){
  survey$invalid.answers[i]<-sum(is.na(survey[i,]))
  }
survey
```
